** About Me
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: ./
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: ../about
  :END:
  I'm currently an engineer a company called Simbe Robotics 
  where I've played a leading role in computer vision and machine learning initiatives.
  Specifically I've spent a lot of time building object detection and OCR systems on home grown and curated datasets.
  I've also played an instrumental role in putting the computer vision models and pipeline in production
  and scaling it to match the needs of our growing customer base.

  My second ever (and apparently most popular) video was about how to use Org-Mode in
  Spacemacs. There's many really good tutorials for Org-Mode but none really focus
  on Spacemacs specifically. I cover:
  - Basic markup syntax
  - Various shortcuts
  - Task tracking, agenda
  - Various shortcuts
    
  Check it out :smile:
