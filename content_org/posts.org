  :END:
  I'm currently an engineer a company called Simbe Robotics 
  where I've played a leading role in computer vision and machine learning initiatives.
  Specifically I've spent a lot of time building object detection and OCR systems on home grown and curated datasets.
  I've also played an instrumental role in putting the computer vision models and pipeline in production
  and scaling it to match the needs of our growing customer base.

** DONE A Response to "Is Numpy Faster than Python?" :python:numba:numpy:julia:

 So I woke up this morning to my google feed recommending the article [[https://towardsdatascience.com/is-numpy-faster-than-python-e8a7363d8276][Is NumPy Faster than Python?]]
 and the first thought through my head was "uhhh ... why is that even a question?". I later realized that
 this was a follow up to the author's previous article called [[https://towardsdatascience.com/should-you-jump-pythons-ship-and-move-to-julia-ccd32e7d25d9]["Should You Jump Python's Ship and Move to Julia?"]].
  
 Upon more investigation it was clear that the author (whose name is Emmett) is a =Julia= evangelist with seemingly very little experience
 in =Python=. Now this is ... fine. I have a great deal of respect for =Julia= and the community around it and the 
 language has come a long way from when I first used it in grad school (as I noticed during my lengthy exploration
 of the language in a past video).
  
 {{< youtube TNoShNPoEak>}}
  
 In face in the above video I did a comparison of how well a naive =Julia= implementation stacks up against a 
 naive Numba implementation of the same simulation (they were about the same). I was then [[https://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-to-optimize-the-following-code/33209][schooled by]] some 
 folks much more knowledgable about =Julia= than I was after my 4 hours session with it and they demonstrated
 that with a bit of care =Julia= could become sufficiently faster than Numba. The fact that such a simple looking
 language could be made so performant says a lot about its potential and I'm eagerly looking forward to what
 becomes of it.
  
 But this post is not about =Julia=.
  
 This post is more of a response to the "Is Numpy Faster than Python" question, but perhaps more importantly
 it serves as an assertion that *"Even if you wanted to, you likely cannot jump =Python='s ship just yet, so 
 how about we talk about how to make the most of this unfortunately less than performant language?"*
  
 OK that's a bit of a mouthful, sorry about that. Let's get to it.
  
*** The base code
    
    What follows is code taken verbatim from the aforementioned article (formatting my own, 
    I just ran [[https://pypi.org/project/black/][black]] on it). First, the pure =Python= implementation which was compared with =Julia=:

    #+begin_src python
def dot(x, y):
    lst = []
    for i, w in zip(x, y):
        lst.append(i * w)
    return lst


def sq(x):
    x = [c ** 2 for c in x]
    return x


class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        # a = ((∑y)(∑x^2)-(∑x)(∑xy)) / (n(∑x^2) - (∑x)^2)
        # b = (x(∑xy) - (∑x)(∑y)) / n(∑x^2) - (∑x)^2
        if len(x) != len(y):
            pass
        # Get our Summations:
        Σx = sum(x)
        Σy = sum(y)
        # dot x and y
        xy = dot(x, y)
        # ∑dot x and y
        Σxy = sum(xy)
        # dotsquare x
        x2 = sq(x)
        # ∑ dotsquare x
        Σx2 = sum(x2)
        # n = sample size
        n = len(x)
        # Calculate a
        self.a = (((Σy) * (Σx2)) - ((Σx * (Σxy)))) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))
        # Calculate b
        self.b = ((n * (Σxy)) - (Σx * Σy)) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))

    def predict(self, xt):
        xt = [self.a + (self.b * i) for i in xt]
        return xt
    #+end_src


    The code is meant to do =Linear Regression= and the API is kind of similar to what you might expect
    from =scikit-learn= (except the initializer takes the place of the =fit= function). If I came across this code
    in a review I would make the following remarks:
    
    - The "if not this then pass" in the initializer is problematic. Kindly replace with an assert or, if you'd prefer not to raise an exception, then let's talk more about your usecase and how you might redesign this.
    - Use =Numpy= arrays and ops rather than =Python= lists and ops.
    - There is already an implementation of this in =scikit-learn=, is there any reason why you can't use that (e.g. don't want to pull in a dependency)?
    
    Now Emmett /did/ rewrite the code with =Numpy= (again, formatting my own and I have removed the comments):
    #+begin_src python
import numpy as np


class npLinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        if len(x) != len(y):
            pass
        Σx = sum(x)
        Σy = sum(y)
        xy = np.multiply(x, y)
        Σxy = sum(xy)
        x2 = np.square(x)
        Σx2 = sum(x2)
        n = len(x)
        self.a = (((Σy) * (Σx2)) - ((Σx * (Σxy)))) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))
        self.b = ((n * (Σxy)) - (Σx * Σy)) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))

    def predict(self, xt):
        xt = [self.a + (self.b * i) for i in xt]
        return xt
    #+end_src
    
    but it's a bit of an unfortunate implementation (and only gives about a 50% speedup over pure =Python= and is 5x or so slower than =Julia=). Let's 
    pretend this is the update to the previous code that was submitted after my pretend review of the above code.
    My next review would likely be as follows:
    - You appear to ultimately still be operating over ==Python== lists and there's probably a lot of casting back and forth between =ndarray= and =List=.
    - =np.multiply= and =np.square= aren't really needed (if =x= and =y= are passed as =numpy= arrays, that is).
    - The =predict= function is completely unchanged.
    
    At this point I might offer the reviewee to do some pair programming with me so I can demonstrate some of the updates
    this code can dearly benefit from. At the end of that review the code would likely look something like this:
    #+begin_src python
      import numpy as np
      class NpLinearRegression:
          def __init__(self, x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> None:
              assert len(x) == len(y), "x and y arrays must have the same number of elements along the first axis"
              Σx = x.sum()
              Σy = y.sum()
              Σxy = (x*y).sum()
              Σx2 = (x**2).sum()
              n = len(x)
        
              self.a = (((Σy) * (Σx2)) - ((Σx * (Σxy)))) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))
              self.b = ((n * (Σxy)) - (Σx * Σy)) / ((n * (Σx2)) - (Σx ** 2))

          def predict(self, xt: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
              return self.a + (self.b * xt)
    #+end_src

    At first blush this may look exactly the same as the last =numpy= implementation but it's subtly different.
    All arrays are now =np.ndarray= (as made clear to the reader and any linters/static checkers by the type hints).
    This not only makes the code smaller (=[self.a + self.b*i for i in xt]= vs =self.a + self.b*xt= but also makes it 
    much faster since all iterations over the arrays now happen in =c= rather than pure =python=.

*** The Tests    
    I'm too lazy to grab the original post's source data so I'm just going to generate my own. Here's my testbed:
    
    #+begin_src python
    import time
    import numpy as np
    factory_map = {'pure_python': LinearRegression, 
                   'numpy_orig': npLinearRegression, 
                   'numpy_correct': NpLinearRegression}
    times_by_method = {}
    Ns = [1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000]
    for method, factory in factory_map.items():
        print(method)
        times = []
        for N in Ns:
            print(N)
            x = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
            y = x + np.random.rand(N)*0.1
            start = time.time()
            for i in range(10):
                _ = factory(x, y).predict(x)
            times.append(time.time() - start)
        times_by_method[method] = times
    #+end_src

    Pretty simple, for each implementation I'm generating data of length 1000 all the way to 10 million (which was
    the number used for the original implementation). Note that the difference between the original two codes 
    and a correct =numpy= implementation is so staggering that I have to put it on a log plot...
    
    #+caption: Timing Plot
    #+attr_html: :width 100
    [[file:./figures/numpy_vs_python_response_timing.png]]

    The absolute numbers here don't quite matter (and don't quite mean anything) and can't be directly compared
    with the Emmett's =Julia= implementation since the machine these ran on (in this case a [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13t7fWYxNSqUpgCfO-sUpE0z9A-s_9KT1?authuser=2#scrollTo=yTweiA7KynYL][Google colab notebook]])
    is not the same as the one used for previous tests. Nevertheless we can compare speedups.
    
    For the 10,000,000 elements case, 10 total runs take 93 seconds in pure =python=. With the original =numpy=
    implementation this goes down to about 39 seconds which is consistent with Emmett's testing. A /correct/ =numpy= 
    implementation, however, gets you to a mere *1.3 seconds*... that's a roughly 72x speedup.
    
    I unfortunately cannot also compare this to Emmett's =python= vs =Julia= comparison by comparing the speedups
    since the timing is not apples to apples. I can still try though it's not clear if the =Julia= =@time= magic he ran was the first
    run of the session or not (since that may or may not involve the JIT compiler) and how many runs of the function
    it did. It /might/ have been a single run in which case the =Python= timing would be =1.22= seconds, implying
    =Julia='s speed up to be only about 4x. Having used =Julia= before I'm reasonably certain that's wrong.
    
*** So what's the takeaway here?    
    1. We're likely stuck with =Python= when it comes to ML and data science (this is an assertion more so than a conclusion).
    2. We should learn to use the various tools at our disposal /correctly/, and learning to grok =numpy= goes a long way.
    3. When comparing the performance of two systems it's a good idea to make sure you understand at least some intricacies of both.

    When I started writing this I thought it may make sense to do a comparison with =Numba= as well, but this post is already gotten 
    too long and I have to start my work day so I'll end it here. I would also like to invite Emmett to update his
    article to include my =numpy= implementation.
    
    Cheers!
