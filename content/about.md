I'm currently an engineer a company called Simbe Robotics
where I've played a leading role in computer vision and machine learning initiatives.
Specifically I've spent a lot of time building object detection and OCR systems on home grown and curated datasets.
I've also played an instrumental role in putting the computer vision models and pipeline in production
and scaling it to match the needs of our growing customer base.
