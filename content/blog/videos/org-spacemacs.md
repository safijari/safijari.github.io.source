My second ever (and apparently most popular) video was about how to use Org-Mode in
Spacemacs. There's many really good tutorials for Org-Mode but none really focus
on Spacemacs specifically. I cover:

-   Basic markup syntax
-   Various shortcuts
-   Task tracking, agenda
-   Various shortcuts

Check it out :smile:
